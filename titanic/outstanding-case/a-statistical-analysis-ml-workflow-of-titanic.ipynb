So, check for them and please <b>leave a comment</b> if you have any suggestions to make them better!! Going back to the topics of this kernel, I will do more in-depth visualizations to explain the data, and the machine learning classifiers will be used to predict passenger survival status.

In a supervised machine learning process, we are giving machine/computer/models specific inputs or data(text/number/image/audio) to learn from aka we are training the machine to learn certain thing based on the data and the output. Now, how do we know what we are teaching is what they are learning? That is where the test set comes to play. We withhold part of the data where we know the output/result of the algorithms, and we use this data to test the trained machine learning model.  We then compare the outcomes to determine machines performance. If you don't you are a bit confused thats okay. I will explain more as we keep reading.

    "We want to see how the left bar(with green and red) changes when we filter out specific unique values of a feature. We can use multiple filters to see if there are any correlations among them. For example, if we click on **upper** and **Female** tab, we would see that green color dominates the bar with 91 survived female passengers with only 3 female passengers that did not survive; a 97% survival rate for females. While if we choose **lower** and **Female**, we would see that, there were 50% chance of females surviving. The age distribution chart on top provides us with some more info such as, what was the age range of those three unlucky females as the red color give away the unsurvived once.

This theory aligns with one other correlation which is the correlation between Fare and Pclass(-0.6). This relationship can be explained by saying that first class passenger(1) paid more for fare then second class passenger(2), similarly second class passenger paid more than the third class passenger(3). This theory can also be supported by mentioning another Pclass correlation with our dependent variable, Survived. The correlation between Pclass and Survived is -0.33.

    "Statistical tests are the scientific way to prove the validation of theories. In any case, when we look at the data, we seem to have an intuitive understanding of where data is leading us. However, when we do statistical tests, we get a scientific or mathematical perspective of how significant these results are. Let's apply some of the trials and see how we are doing with our predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Hypothesis Testing Outline\n",
    "\n",
    "A hypothesis test compares the mean of a control group and experimental group and tries to find out whether the two sample means are different from each other and if they are different, how significant that difference is.\n",
    " \n",
    "A **hypothesis test** usually consists of multiple parts: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Formulate a well-developed research problem or question: The hypothesis test usually starts with a concrete and well-developed researched problem. We need to ask the right question that can be answered using statistical analyses. \n",
    "2. The null hypothesis ($H_0$) and Alternating hypothesis($H_1$):\n",
    "> * The **null hypothesis($H_0$)** is something that is assumed to be true. It is the status quo. In a null hypothesis, the observations are the result of pure chance. When we set out to experiment, we form the null hypothesis by saying that there is no difference between the means of the control group and the experimental group.\n",
    "> *  An **Alternative hypothesis($H_A$)** is a claim and the opposite of the null hypothesis.  It is going against the status quo. In an alternative theory, the observations show a real effect combined with a component of chance variation.\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. Determine the **test statistic**: test statistic can be used to assess the truth of the null hypothesis. Depending on the standard deviation we either use t-statistics or z-statistics. In addition to that, we want to identify whether the test is a one-tailed test or two-tailed test. \n",
    "\n",
    "4. Specify a **Significance level**: The significance level($\\alpha$) is the probability of rejecting a null hypothesis when it is true. In other words, we are ***comfortable/confident*** with rejecting the null hypothesis a significant amount of times even though it is true. This considerable amount is our Significant level. In addition to that significance level is one minus our Confidence interval. For example, if we say, our significance level is 5%, then our confidence interval would be (1 - 0.05) = 0.95 or 95%. \n",
    "\n",
    "5. Compute the **T-statistics**: Computing the t-statistics follows a simple equation. This equation slightly differs depending on one sample test or two sample test  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. Compute the **P-value**: P-value is the probability that a test statistic at least as significant as the one observed would be obtained assuming that the null hypothesis was correct. The p-value is known to be unintuitive, and even many professors are known to explain it wrong. I think this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4KCfcVwzyw) explains the p-value well. **The smaller the P-value, the stronger the evidence against the null hypothesis.**\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Describe the result and compare the p-value with the significance value($\\alpha$)**: If p<= $\\alpha$, then the observed effect is statistically significant, the null hypothesis is ruled out, and the alternative hypothesis is valid. However if the p> $\\alpha$, we say that, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. Even though this sentence is grammatically wrong, it is logically right. We never accept the null hypothesis just because we are doing the statistical test with sample data points.\n",

The group can be any gathering of multiple numbers such as animal, human, plants, money, stocks.* For example, To find the age population mean of Bulgaria; we have to account for every single person's age and take their age. Which is almost impossible and if we were to go that route; there is no point of doing statistics in the first place. Therefore we approach this problem using sample sets. The idea of using sample set is that; if we take multiple samples of the same population and take the mean of them and put them in a distribution; eventually our distribution start to look more like a **normal distribution**. The more samples we take and the more sample means with be added and the closer the normal distribution with reach towards population mean. This is where **Central limit theory** comes from. We will go into this topic later on. \n",

If you are curious about that, I have the answer. For this competition, when we train the machine learning algorithms, we use part of the training set usually two-thirds of the train data. Once we train our algorithm using 2/3 of the train data, we start to test our algorithms using the remaining data. If the model performs well we dump our test data in the algorithms to predict and submit the competition. The code below, basically splits the train data into 4 parts, **train_x**, **test_x**, **train_y**, **test_y**.  \n",

    "![](https://cdncontribute.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/fittings.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "As you see in the chart above. **Underfitting** is when the model fails to capture important aspects of the data and therefore introduces more bias and performs poorly. On the other hand, **Overfitting** is when the model performs too well on the training data but does poorly in the validation set or test sets.  This situation is also known as having less bias but more variation and perform poorly as well. Ideally, we want to configure a model that performs well not only in the training data but also in the test data. This is where **bias-variance tradeoff** comes in. When we have a model that overfits meaning less biased and more chance of variance, we introduce some bias in exchange of having much less variance. One particular tactic for this task is regularization models (Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net).  These models are built to deal with the bias-variance tradeoff. This [kernel](https://www.kaggle.com/dansbecker/underfitting-and-overfitting) explains this topic well. Also, the following chart gives us a mental picture of where we want our models to be. \n",

However, the most critical part is the error rates. We want our models to be at the bottom of that **U** shape where the error rate is the least. That sweet spot is also known as **Optimum Model Complexity(OMC).**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Gridsearch** is a simple concept but effective technique in Machine Learning. The word **GridSearch** stands for the fact that we are searching for optimal parameter/parameters over a \"grid.\" These optimal parameters are also known as **Hyperparameters**. **The Hyperparameters are model parameters that are set before fitting the model and determine the behavior of the model.**. For example, when we choose to use linear regression, we may decide to add a penalty to the loss function such as Ridge or Lasso. These penalties require specific alpha (the strength of the regularization technique) to set beforehand. The higher the value of alpha, the more penalty is being added. GridSearch finds the optimal value of alpha among a range of values provided by us, and then we go on and use that optimal value to fit the model and get sweet results. It is essential to understand those model parameters are different from models outcomes, for example, **coefficients** or model evaluation metrics such as **accuracy score** or **mean squared error**.\n",

    "Among all the machine learning models decision tree is one of my favorite. Let's briefly talk about it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the decision tree is pretty simple. To build a tree, we use a decision tree algorithm called CART. CART stands for Classification and Regression Trees. This means the decision tree can be used for both regression and classifications problems. To perform classification or regression, decision trees make sequential, hierarchical decisions about the outcome variable based on the predictor data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Decision tree works by breaking down the dataset into small subsets. This breaking down process is done by asking questions about the features of the datasets. The idea is to unmix the labels by asking fewer questions necessary. As we ask questions, we are breaking down the dataset into more subsets. Once we have a subgroup with only the unique type of labels, we end the tree in that node. We call this the leaf node. Here is an excellent example of the decision tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1200/1*GgUEazXbr2CYLUsPgdYzDw.png\" width=\"600\">\n",
    "\n",
    "If you think about it, this is sort of like the \"20 Questions\" game where an individual or group has the opportunity to identify an unknown object by asking a series of up to 20 \"yes\" or \"no\" questions. For example, if we want to tie it with this dataset, let's say we are asking to find out whether a certain person in the test dataset survived or not. We may ask a question like, is the person \"male\" or \"female.\" Let's say the answer is \"female.\" Then the algorithm might ask about the person's Pclass. Let's say the Pclass is 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see by inquiring these details about this person we can give a certain percentage with confidence about a person's survival status. If you want to know more how the decision tree does all these mathematically and technically,  you can keep on reading. Otherwise, you can skip to the next section. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first, we will add a root node for the tree. All node receives a list of rows from the dataset.  The root node receives the whole dataset.  This node then asks true/false questions about one of the features. Based on the answer, we split the dataset into smaller subsets. The number of subsets depends on the unique values of that feature. These subsets then become the input of each child nodes. Each child node then asks another question about a different feature leading to break down further into more subgroups. This process goes on. As we keep reading, one questions beg to be answered. How do we know which questions to ask and when? \n",
    "\n",
    "<b>The trick to building an effective tree is to know which questions to ask and when.</b> To find the best possible questions, we need to quantify how much uncertainty is there in a single node and how much a question help to unmix the labels. We can find out how much uncertainty/impurity is there in a single node using a concept called <i>Gini Impurity</i>. We can find out how much a question reduces that uncertainty using a matrix called <i>Information gain.</i> These two combined helps us decide which question to ask in each node. Let's dive into how these are calculated.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Gini Impurity:</h3>\n",
    "Gini Impurity ranges between 0 and 1, where a lower value indicates less uncertainty and a higher value indicates higher uncertainty. In other words, when we look at the Gini index we want to look the at the lower value of Gini Index as those are the once produced the most unmixed subsets. A really good video about calculating Gini index is [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7VeUPuFGJHk). \n",
    "\n",
    "gini impurity quantifies our chances of being incorrect if we randomly assign a label to an example in the same set. For example, Let's say there are 5 different mixes with five different labels, Our chance of being right is 1/5. So, our chances of being wrong is (1-1/5) = 0.8. So, 0.8 is our Gini Impurity score. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the equation for Gini score. \n",
    "\n",
    "### $$ \\text{Gini} = \\sum_{i=1}^{classes} p(i\\;|\\;t)(1 -p(i\\;|\\;t)) = 1 - \\sum_{i=1}^{classes} p(i\\;|\\;t)^2 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### This part of the kernel is a working progress. Please check back again for future updates.#### \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<h3>Information Gain</h3>\n",
    "Information gain is basically difference between the Gini Index of the parent note and the <b>weighted</b> average of the child nodes.\n",
